                    My name is Ramcharan Chirapu, but most people know me as Ram. I'm a junior at 
                    <a href="https://cc.sduhsd.net/" target="_blank">Canyon Crest Academy</a>, and I live 
                    with my parents and my older sibling, who's currently in college. I would describe myself 
                    as a somewhat extroverted person who enjoys being around others, but I also have moments 
                    where I prefer to be alone and recharge. I try to stay calm in most situations and not let 
                    stress get the best of me, which helps me stay focused even when things get overwhelming. 
                    I consider myself a kind and understanding person who values peace and balance in my daily life.

                    <p class="highlight">
                        Some of the things that make me who I am are, for example, playing 
                        <a href="https://www.nba.com/" target="_blank">basketball</a>, spending time with my 
                        friends, and playing video games. Playing basketball has helped me learn teamwork and 
                        perseverance in the face of challenges, whereas spending time with friends keeps me 
                        grounded and attached. I also enjoy listening to music and going for walks when I need 
                        some alone time to relax and clear my head. They make me think about my thoughts and 
                        recharge when the world looks to be too much. My hobbies and interests teach me that 
                        the balance between being on the go and being alone is what an individual should develop.

                    <h3>Learning About Comparison and Self-Acceptance</h3>
                    <img src="images/download (2).jpeg" alt="Inspirational quote" id="pic3">
                    <p class="bold">
                        Lately, I've been thinking a lot about how easy it is to compare ourselves to others, 
                        especially in high school. The quote <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/mindful-musings/202201/comparison-is-the-thief-joy" target="_blank">"Comparison is the thief of joy"</a> really connects with me because it shows how 
                        comparison can take away our happiness and confidence. I've had moments where I've doubted 
                        myself or felt like I wasn't doing enough compared to others, but I've realized that everyone 
                        has their own strengths and weaknesses. Negative comparisons can really affect someone's 
                        mental state and make them forget what they're good at. I've been learning to focus more on 
                        my own progress and to appreciate the things that make me who I am.
