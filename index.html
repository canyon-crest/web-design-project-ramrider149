<h3>Who I Am</h3>
<p>

  <br>
My name is Ramcharan Chirapu, but most people know me as Ram. I’m a junior at <a href="https://cc.sduhsd.net/" target="_blank">Canyon Crest Academy</a>, and I live with my parents and my older sibling, who’s currently in college. I would describe myself as a somewhat 
extroverted person who enjoys being around others, but I also have moments where I prefer to be alone and recharge. I try to stay calm in most situations and not let stress get the best of me, which helps me stay focused
 even when things get overwhelming. I consider myself a kind and understanding person who values peace and balance in my daily life.

<h3>My Interests and What They Mean to Me</h3>

Some of the things that make me who I am are, for example, playing
<a href="https://www.nba.com/" target="_blank">basketball</a>, 
spending time with my friends, and playing video games. 
Playing basketball has helped me learn teamwork and 
perseverance in the face of challenges, whereas spending 
time with friends keeps me grounded and attached.
 I also enjoy listening to music and going for walks when 
 I need some alone time to relax and clear my head. They make me 
 think about my thoughts and recharge when the world looks to be too much. 
 My hobbies and interests teach me that the balance between being
on the go and being alone is what an individual should develop.

<h3>Learning About Comparison and Self-Acceptance</h3>
<p>

  <br>
Lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about how easy it is to compare ourselves to others, especially in high school. The quote “Comparison is the thief of joy” really connects with me because it shows how 
comparison can take away our happiness and confidence. I’ve had moments where I’ve doubted myself or felt like I wasn’t doing enough compared to others, but I’ve realized that everyone has their own 
strengths and weaknesses. Negative comparisons can really affect someone’s mental state and make them forget what they’re good at. I’ve been learning to focus more on my own progress and to appreciate
 the things that make me who I am.
